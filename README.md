# shift
converts from binary representation to numeral and back again

shift.c:
This program takes a number and converts to a binary position 
representation of that number.
For example:
The number 3 will set the third position in a binary number equal to 00000100  (4)
The number 4 will set the fourth position in a binary number equal to 00001000 (8)

shift1.c
This program takes a binary position and converts it to the number it represents  
For example:
The third position in a binary number equal to 00000100 (4) will be converted to the number 3
The fourth position in a binary number equal to 00001000 (8) will be converted to the number 4

When using an integer to represent many from by ORing them together

#define BLUE   1</br>
#define YELLOW 2</br>
#define ORANGE 4</br>
#define WHITE  8</br>

Then I take input in a program to change selection "3" which would translate to ORANGE
